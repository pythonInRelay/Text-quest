# Test Quest (Afterthought Game)

### Made in Unity 2019
A simple text based adventure game I created in Unity.

The main purpose was to write a game from the beginning utilising best-practices while learing about game 'states' and how to efficiently organise game logic. In doing so, I created an easy framework in which more states (rooms) can be added simply to expand and improve the game story without 'reinventing the wheel' or getting complicated.

### Methods Used
* Created an array to store states
* Basic UI design
* Key inmput mapping
* TextMeshPro package was used to create and manage font effects
* C# scripting
* Git for VCS
* Story logic was crafted using Draw.io (.xml is included in the repo root)

____________________________________________

### Game Logic:
The player can move from room (state) to room until they complete or fail the game.

### Controls:
Press key 1 for option 1 and key 2 for option 2.

Total time to completion was around 1 hour.
