# Test Quest

### Made in Unity 2019

A simple text based adventure game I created in Unity.

The main purpose was to learn about game 'states' and organise game logic. Thus creating an easy framework in which more states (rooms) can be added simply to expand and improve the game story.
The player can move from room (state) to room until they complete or fail the game.

Creating an array to store states as well as basic UI design and button mapping was also performed.
Press 1 for option 1 and 2 for option 2.

Game logic was drafted in Draw.io and the .xml is included in the repo.

Total time to completion was around 30 minutes.
