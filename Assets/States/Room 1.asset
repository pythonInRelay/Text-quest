  storyText: 'You open the backpack and are immediately repulsed by the stench of
    what smells like vomit and rotting food.

    The smell makes you gag and you
    fling the backpack to the ground, at which point you hear a cracking sound.


    After
    a few minutes your senses have returned properly and you reach for the backpack
    again, this time holding your breath.


    Inside sure enough is vomit, though
    it does not appear to be yours. Whilst the taste of bile is present in your throat,
    you are sure that you have not thrown up recently.


    In the front pocket
    of the backpack you pull out a mobile phone. It is broken, presumably from you
    throwing the bag.


    Choices


    1. Try the broken phone

    2. Examine
    your surroundings'
