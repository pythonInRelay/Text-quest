    Dad
    - Son where the fuck are you? Your flight is going to leave in 15 minutes.

    Why
    I am even bothering to message you I have no idea. I spend all this money on
    your tuition and tickets to send you to the best school possible, but you don''t
    even show up for your plane?

    For god''s sake answer the phone!


    As
    your eyes finish reading the final sentence, the phone dies. It is useless now.


    Choices:


    1.
    Try the phone again

    2. Examine your surroundings'
