  storyText: 'You check your surroundings. There aren''t a whole lot of trees around,
    and nothing is making any noise either. The air is damp and cold.


    Faintly
    you can see the moonlight shining through the trees, though through the canopy
    you can''t directly see the moon.


    Your clothes seem to be in okay condition,
    but your head and muscles hurt. It''s clear that you have been sleeping for quite
    some time.


    Choices:


    1. Start walking towards the moon

    2. Walk
    in the opposite direction of the moon'
