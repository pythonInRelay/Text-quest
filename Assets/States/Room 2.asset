  storyText: 'You decide to wait a few more minutes for your senses to return. In
    the meantime you start to notice a horrible smell coming from the backpack. With
    every passing second the smell is getting worse and worse.


    You move away
    from the backpack as the smell now is getting beyond your ability to handle it.


    Finding
    a stick close by you use it to carefully open the large pouch, the smell is terrible.
    It smells like days old vomit. What-ever is further inside this compartment cannot
    possibly be worth the trouble of exposing yourself to more of the smell.


    Opening
    the front compartment though you notice a phone and pick it up.


    You notice
    immediately that the battery level is at only 1%, that is, the phone is almost
    dead.

    It will probably have enough battery for only one brief action before
    dying.


    Choices

    1. Check messages

    2. Call emergency number'
