  storyText: 'You''ve woken up in the middle of what looks like a forest, at the
    cusp of dusk. The air smells damp and your head is pounding. You have no recollection
    of how you arrived at this location.


    Your body is cold, slow and aching.
    Slowly you start to feel hungry.


    Clumsily you instinctively move your hand,
    whereby it brushes upon what seems to be a backpack.


    Choices


    1. Open
    the backpack

    2. Wait longer for your senses to return.'
