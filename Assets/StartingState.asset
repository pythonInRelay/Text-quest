  storyText: 'You have awoken from what seems like an endless slumber...


    As
    your eyesights returns, you realise that you are lying in a field, on the cusp
    of dusk.


    With your eyesight mostly returned, your other senses are also
    coming back slowly. Your neck is sore and you realise you must have awoken from
    the cold of dusk.


    Instinctively you reach out your right hand, to which
    you find a backpack.


    Choose your action:


    1. Open the backpack

    2.
    Wait for the rest of your senses to return'
